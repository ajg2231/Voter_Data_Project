Team members: Alex Goldstein, Jeff Johnson, Melvin Byrd, Katie Carns

### Purpose:
 Observation of North Carolina's GOP shift from the 2016 election to the 2020 election. 

### Summary:
 Interested in following the migration of Bachelor's Degree Educated voters in North Carolina over the last two election cycles either towards or away from the GOP. In addition weâ€™re also looking for the movement of polling locations in North Carolina over the same time period tracking ease of voting.

* Changes in voter registration by county (Democrat vs Republican)
* Concentration of college educated adults vs. adults with no degree in each respective county.
* Investigate any change in polling locations (number or physical location) to determine North Carolinians ability to vote.

### Visuals:
* Hosting on GitHub-io
* Map overlay of polling locations using leaflet markers
* Plotly.js graphs
